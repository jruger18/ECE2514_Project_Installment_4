# ECE2514_Project_Installment_4
Repository for sharing the code files each group member is working individually.

The goal is that code can be accessed from any machine, and a backup copy is kept even if local copies get corrupted or lost.

While most work will be done individually, this will allow each member to contribute to all aspects of the project.
